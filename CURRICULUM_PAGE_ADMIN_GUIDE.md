## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Required Fields:**
- `slug` must be exactly `"curriculum"` (lowercase, no spaces)
- `products` array must have valid JSON syntax
- Each curriculum item needs an `id` field

‚úÖ **Fallback Behavior:**
- If no Product-Page exists with slug "curriculum", the page shows the original hardcoded content
- Layout never changes - only the content source switches between database and static

üé® **Layout Preserved:**
- All existing styles, animations, filters, and interactions remain unchanged
- The visual design stays exactly the same

---

## Testing

1. **Without Product-Page**: Page shows original static content
2. **With Product-Page**: Page shows your admin-configured content
3. **Invalid JSON**: Page falls back to static content (check browser console for errors)

---

## Future Enhancements

You can later add to each curriculum item:
- `image_url`: Featured image from R2 storage
- `video_url`: Intro video
- `pricing`: Pricing information
- `duration`: Course duration
- `level`: Difficulty level

These fields will be ignored for now but can be displayed when you're ready to enhance the layout.
