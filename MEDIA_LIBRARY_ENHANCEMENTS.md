## 🔧 Enhancement Details

### 1. Drag & Drop Upload

**Location:** `src/app/admin/media/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Drag files from desktop directly into the media library
- Visual feedback with overlay when dragging files
- Supports single and multiple file uploads

- Automatically uploads to current folder

**Usage:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/media`
2. Drag one or more files from your desktop
3. Drop them anywhere in the files area
4. Files will upload automatically

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// State for drag feedback
const [isDragging, setIsDragging] = useState(false);

// Drag event handlers
handleDragOver() - Prevents default and shows overlay
handleDragLeave() - Hides overlay
handleDrop() - Extracts files and triggers upload

// Unified upload function
uploadFiles() - Handles both manual and drag & drop uploads
```
