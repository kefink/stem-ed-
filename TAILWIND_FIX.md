# 🔧 TailwindCSS 4.x Configuration Fix

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Problem:**

```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin.
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package...
```

### **Root Cause:**

TailwindCSS 4.x changed how it integrates with PostCSS. The old `tailwindcss` plugin is deprecated and replaced with `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

---

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **Updated PostCSS Configuration**

**File:** `postcss.config.mjs`

**Before:**

```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

**After:**

```javascript
const config = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};
```

### 2. **Updated CSS Imports**

**File:** `src/app/globals.css`

**Before:**

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

**After:**

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### 3. **Installed Required Package**

```bash
npm install --save-dev @tailwindcss/postcss
```

## ✅ **Result:**

```
✓ Ready in 5.7s
```
