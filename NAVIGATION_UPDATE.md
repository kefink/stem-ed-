# 🎉 Hydration Error Fixed + New Pages Added!

## ✅ **Issues Resolved:**

### **1. Hydration Error Fixed**

**Problem:** Browser extension adding `rtrvr-listeners` attribute causing mismatch between server and client HTML.

**Solution:** Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` and `<body>` tags in `layout.tsx`

```tsx
<html suppressHydrationWarning>
  <body suppressHydrationWarning>
```

This tells React to ignore hydration mismatches caused by browser extensions.
