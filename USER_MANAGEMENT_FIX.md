# User Management Page - Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

When visiting `http://localhost:3000/admin/users`, the page was returning **401 Unauthorized** errors and users were not being fetched from the database. Filtering by role also showed no users.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Authentication Token Issue**

- The page was trying to use `session.accessToken` directly from the `useSession` hook
- However, this doesn't work reliably because the session prop doesn't immediately have the access token
- **Solution**: Use the `fetchWithAuth` utility that properly calls `getSession()` from `next-auth/react`

### 2. **Database Schema Mismatch**

- Backend was using `is_active` field which doesn't exist in the User model
- The actual field in the database is `is_locked` (inverted logic)
- **Solution**: Updated all backend endpoints and frontend to use `is_locked` instead

### 3. **Field Name Mismatch**

- Backend was using `user.is_verified` but database column is `is_email_verified`
- Backend was referencing `user.created_at` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Fixed all field references to match the actual User model

## Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin/users.py`)

1. **Updated Schemas**:

   - Changed `is_active: bool` → `is_locked: bool` in `UserResponse`
   - Changed `is_active: bool` → `is_locked: bool` in `UserCreateRequest`
   - Changed `is_active: Optional[bool]` → `is_locked: Optional[bool]` in `UserUpdateRequest`

2. **Fixed Field References**:

   - `user.is_verified` → `user.is_email_verified`
   - `user.is_active` → `user.is_locked`
   - Added `hasattr` checks for `created_at` field
   - `user.two_factor_secret is not None` → `user.two_factor_enabled`

3. **Updated Query Order**:
   - Changed from `order_by(desc(User.created_at))` to `order_by(desc(User.id))`
   - This works since `created_at` doesn't exist in the model

### Frontend (`src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`)

1. **Added fetchWithAuth Import**:

   ```typescript
   import { fetchWithAuth } from "@/lib/fetchWithAuth";
   ```

2. **Updated Type Definition**:

   ```typescript
   type User = {
     // ...
     is_locked: boolean; // was is_active
     // ...
   };
   ```

3. **Updated Form State**:

   ```typescript
   const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
     // ...
     is_locked: false, // was is_active: true
     // ...
   });
   ```

4. **Replaced fetch() Calls**:

   - `loadUsers()`: Now uses `fetchWithAuth(url)` instead of `fetch(url, { headers: {...} })`
   - `handleCreateUser()`: Now uses `fetchWithAuth(url, { method: "POST", body: ... })`
   - `handleUpdateUser()`: Now uses `fetchWithAuth(url, { method: "PUT", body: ... })`
   - `handleDeleteUser()`: Now uses `fetchWithAuth(url, { method: "DELETE" })`

5. **Updated UI Labels**:
   - Status badge: Shows "Active" when `!user.is_locked`, "Locked" when `user.is_locked`
   - Form checkbox: Changed from "Active" to "Locked"

### Analytics Dashboard (`src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`)

1. **Added fetchWithAuth Import**
2. **Updated loadStats()** to use `fetchWithAuth()` instead of manual `fetch()` with headers

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:

1. User logs in → NextAuth stores JWT tokens in session
2. Page loads → Calls `fetchWithAuth()`
3. `fetchWithAuth()` → Calls `getSession()` to get fresh access token
4. Token is automatically added to `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
5. Backend validates token with `require_admin` dependency
6. Data is returned successfully

### Role Filtering:

- When you select "Admin" or "User" from the dropdown:
  - Sets `roleFilter` state
  - `useEffect` triggers and calls `loadUsers()`
  - URL becomes: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/users?page=1&page_size=20&role=admin`
  - Backend filters: `if role: query = query.filter(User.role == role)`
  - Only users with that role are returned

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the servers** (already running):

   ```bash
   # Backend: http://localhost:8000
   # Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Login as admin**:

   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use an admin account

3. **Visit User Management**:

   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/users
   - You should see all users in the database

4. **Test Filtering**:

   - Click "All Roles" dropdown
   - Select "Admin" → Should show only admin users
   - Select "User" → Should show only regular users
   - Select "All Roles" → Should show all users again

5. **Test Search**:

   - Type in the search box (searches email and name)
   - Users should filter in real-time

6. **Test CRUD Operations**:
   - Click "➕ Add User" → Create a new user
   - Click "Edit" on any user → Update their details
   - Click "Delete" → Remove a user (with confirmation)

## Expected Results

✅ Users list loads successfully  
✅ Role filtering works (Admin/User)  
✅ Search works (by email/name)  
✅ Pagination works (20 per page)  
✅ Create user works  
✅ Edit user works  
✅ Delete user works (except yourself)  
✅ No more 401 errors  
✅ Status badges show correctly (Verified/Unverified, Active/Locked)

## Database Fields Reference

### User Model (actual fields):

- `id` - Primary key
- `email` - User email (unique)
- `full_name` - Full name (nullable)
- `hashed_password` - Hashed password
- `role` - User role (admin/user)
- `is_email_verified` - Email verification status
- `is_locked` - Account locked status
- `two_factor_enabled` - 2FA enabled
- `two_factor_secret` - 2FA secret
- ... and other 2FA/lockout fields

### NOT in the model:

- ❌ `is_active` (we use `is_locked` with inverted logic)
- ❌ `created_at` (doesn't exist in current schema)
- ❌ `is_verified` (actual name is `is_email_verified`)

## Files Modified

### Backend:

- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin/users.py` (schema and endpoint fixes)

### Frontend:

- `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` (authentication and field name fixes)
- `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` (authentication fixes)

## Future Improvements

1. **Add created_at field** to User model if timestamp tracking is needed
2. **Consider renaming** `is_email_verified` to just `is_verified` for consistency
3. **Add more filters**: by verification status, by locked status
4. **Add bulk operations**: bulk delete, bulk verify, etc.
5. **Add export**: Export user list to CSV
6. **Add user activity log**: Track user actions
