ALLOWED_IMAGE_TYPES = {
    "image/jpeg", 
    "image/png", 
    "image/gif",

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to upload file"

**Check:**
1. File size < 10MB
2. File type is supported (images/PDFs)
3. Backend server is running
4. `uploads/media` directory exists and is writable

### "Images not displaying"

**Check:**
1. Backend static files mounted correctly
2. URL is correct: `http://localhost:8000/uploads/media/...`
3. File exists in `backend/uploads/media/`
4. File permissions are correct

### "Cannot create folder"

**Check:**
1. Folder name is not empty
2. You're logged in as admin
3. Backend database is running
4. No duplicate folder names at same level

### "Folder won't delete"

**Reason:** Folder contains files or subfolders

**Solution:**
1. Delete all files in folder first
2. Delete all subfolders
3. Then delete parent folder

## 📊 Performance Notes

### Current Implementation (Local Storage)
- **Pro:** Fast, simple, no external dependencies
- **Pro:** No costs
- **Con:** Limited by server disk space
- **Con:** Files not backed up automatically
- **Con:** Single point of failure

### Recommended for Production
- Use cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary, Azure Blob)
- Implement CDN for faster delivery
- Set up automatic backups
- Use object storage for scalability

## 🎉 Summary

**Media Library is COMPLETE!** ✅

You now have:
- ✅ Full file upload and management
- ✅ Folder organization
- ✅ Image preview
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Copy URLs for use
- ✅ Admin-only access
