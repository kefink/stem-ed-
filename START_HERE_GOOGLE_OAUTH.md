## üöÄ QUICKSTART (3 Steps)

If you just want to get started fast:

### STEP 1: Go to Google Cloud Console

üëâ **https://console.cloud.google.com/**

Create a project and OAuth client ID

### STEP 2: Get Two Things

- Client ID: `123456-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Client Secret: `GOCSPX-xxxxx`

### STEP 3: Put Them in .env.local

File: `c:\Users\MKT\desktop\kb\stem-ed-architects\.env.local`

Replace these lines:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-secret-here
```

Then restart server and test at http://localhost:3000/login

## üìç WHAT'S ALREADY DONE

‚úÖ Auth code is written and working  
‚úÖ Login page has Google button  
‚úÖ Register page has Google button  
‚úÖ .env.local file is created with placeholders  
‚úÖ All documentation is ready

## üéØ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

1. ‚è≥ Get Google OAuth credentials (10 minutes)
2. ‚è≥ Update .env.local with your credentials (1 minute)
3. ‚è≥ Restart server and test (2 minutes)

**Total time:** ~15 minutes

## üÜò IF YOU GET STUCK

### Most Common Issue: "Redirect URI mismatch"

**Fix:** Make sure your redirect URI is EXACTLY:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
```

No trailing slash! Check spelling!

### Second Most Common: Google button doesn't work

**Fix:**

1. Check .env.local has your actual credentials (not placeholders)
2. Restart your dev server
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Third Most Common: "This app isn't verified"

**Fix:** This is normal in development!

- Click "Advanced"
- Click "Go to STEM-ED Architects (unsafe)"
- This only appears for unverified apps

## üéì LEARNING PATH

### If you're new to OAuth:

1. Read **GOOGLE_OAUTH_STEP_BY_STEP.md** first
2. Follow **GOOGLE_OAUTH_CHECKLIST.md** while setting up
3. Keep **QUICK_REFERENCE_GOOGLE_OAUTH.md** open for URLs

### If you've done OAuth before:

1. Use **QUICK_REFERENCE_GOOGLE_OAUTH.md** only
2. Should take ~10 minutes total

### If something breaks:

1. Check **GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md** ‚Üí Troubleshooting section
2. Check browser console (F12)
3. Verify .env.local has correct values
4. Restart server
